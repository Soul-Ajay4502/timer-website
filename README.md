## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the technical evaluation for the **Front End Developer** role at **Techware Lab**. The goal is to create two specific interactive features for a website called **Introdo**:

1. **Tab Switching Feature**  
2. **Unlock The Perks Section**

## Features Implemented

### 1. Tab Switching Feature

- **Auto-Switch Mechanism**:  
  Tabs will automatically switch every 5 seconds, providing a seamless transition between different sections.
  
- **Manual Interaction**:  
  Users can manually switch between tabs. Upon manual interaction, the auto-switch timer will reset, ensuring the user has 5 seconds before the next automatic switch.

- **Visual Feedback**:  
  The active tab is highlighted with smooth transitions to enhance user experience and make navigation clear.

### 2. Unlock The Perks Section

- **Timer**:  
  A countdown timer starts at 14:00 and ends at 14:59, simulating a one-hour duration.

- **Progress Bar**:  
  The progress bar is synced with the timer, dynamically filling from 0% at 14:00 to 100% at 14:59, visually indicating the passage of time.
